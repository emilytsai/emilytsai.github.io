      <h4>[August 2013 - Present]</h4>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~reach/?page_id=13">REACH! Shadow program</a> is one of the many events that the <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~reach/">REACH! Asian/Pacific Islander Retention and Recruitment Center</a> organizes each year. Each year, we host over a hundred students with two ShadowNites and a Shadow Day.</p>
      <p>ShadowNite is a 3 day-2 night semesterly program that recruits under-served high school students from various regions of California to experience an enriching weekend at UC Berkeley filled with college admission, political awareness, and youth empowerment workshops.</p>
      <p>Shadow Day is a similar event that occurs over the span of a single day. They are often major collaboration events with <a href="http://www.bridgesberkeley.org/">bridges</a>, the multicultural resource center, or other off-campus organizations, such as <a href="http://thespotoakland.org/">The Spot Youth Center</a> in Oakland.</p>

      <h5>Shadow Mission Statement:</h5>
      <p>"Shadow is a mentorship program whose purpose is to inspire underprivileged, low-income, and non-college bound high school students into understanding that higher education is accessible, important, and A RIGHT. Shadow attempts to help students understand that higher education is a form of empowerment to challenge their current economic status and the social injustice they currently face within their respective communities. Through mentorship, inspirational, academic, team building, and political awareness workshops and activities coordinated by college students who have an understanding and passion for progressive social change, Shadow provides the tools high school students need to critically evaluate their life experiences so that they can be empowered to pursue higher education. However, we want students to know that higher education is but one option and is not the only option."</p>

      <p class="subtitle">Fall and Spring 2013-2014</p>
      <p>As an intern, I was the Internal Affairs Intern (Fall)/Finance and Catering Intern (Spring). In these roles, I was in charge of:
      <ul>
        <li>ordering and organizing food</li>
        <li>keeping track of allergies</li>
        <li>delegating food pick-ups/drop-offs</li>
        <li>assigning housing pairs between mentors and mentees</li>
        <li>helping to organize car assignments for housing drop-offs</li>
        <li>calling/keeping in contact with housers to update arrival and pick-up times</li>
        <li>keeping track of budgeting and receipts</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>As one of the co-coordinators of Shadow and a coordinator (core) of REACH!, my co and I were completely in charge of our program. One of the biggest changes we brought to the Shadow program that year was the introduction of the family system: groups of 7-8 mentees were paired with a pair of family heads, and a few activities throughout the weekened were done in families. Our aim was to help facilitate mingling with students across different high schools and have mentees create closer bonds in small groups. Although the system is still not perfect at satisfying our goals completely, it's still currently being used today. As a coordinator, some of the things I organized were:
      <ul>
        <li>overseeing and developing intern roles and responsibilities</li>
        <li>recruiting and training mentors and volunteers</li>
        <li>researching and contacting schools that meet our criteria</li>
        <li>setting expectations for mentee acceptances and reviewing applications as a team</li>
        <li>taking calls, emails, and meetings with parents, students, and outside resources</li>
        <li>conducting and attending 3-5 meetings a week to plan events and discuss issues prevalent in the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) community</li>
        <li>facilitating team bonding and productivity</li>
        <li>organizing and developing workshops</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <div class="clear"></div>
      <p class="subtitle">Fall and Spring 2015-2016</p>
      <p>As a mentor and volunteer, I helped provide housing, transportation, and facilitated one of the workshops for the mentees. Although I sat in on most workshops and activities to help facilitate discussions, most of the time was spent on getting to know individual mentees throughout the weekend and answering questions they had on college and post-HS options.</p>
