        cal day scheduler
      </h2>

      <p>
        Course: CS 198 - Ruby on Rails DeCal<br>
        Semester: Spring 2016<br>
        Team: Alexander Ros, Caroline Kim, Emily Pedersen, Emily Tsai<br>
        Github repository: [<a href="https://caldayscheduler.herokuapp.com/">project-calday</a>]
      </p>
      
      <h5>THE CONCEPT</h5>
      <p>When I attended Cal Day as an incoming freshman, I had loads of fun walking around campus, exploring things as it passed by. However, the large and expanse campus, coupled with the thousands of people and hundreds of activities going on at the same time, made the day a bit hectic.</p>
      <p>The Cal Day Scheduler web application was built with the idea that it would help organize this process, both for the campus organizations involved as well as the new students who come to visit. Through this scheduler, organizations are able to quickly create publicized events; visitors can then easily view and save interesting events to their personal schedule. Thus, instead of filtering through pages of activities, times, and places for events that interest them, Cal Day visitors can use the web application to easily personalize and organize their own Cal Day efficiently.</p>

      <h5>USING THE APPLICATION</h5>
      <p>Upon entering the home page of the website, users will be prompted to log in or sign up as a 'Student', 'Organization', or 'Leader'. Organizations use this Scheduler to create, publicize, and keep track of their Cal Day events. Students are the visitors or current Cal students who plan to use the web application to organize their Cal Day event schedule. Leaders, or the Cal Day workers and volunteers, can use the Scheduler to view, navigate, and familiarize themselves with all the events and their locations.</p>

      <div class="thirds"><img src="assets/images/student-profile.png"></div>
      <div class="clear"></div>
      <p class="subtitle">The registration, login, and profile page of a 'student' user.</p>

      <h5>Organizations</h5>
      <p>After making an account, organizations can easily and quickly create an event for Cal Day by inputting an event name, description, and start time. It will then be assigned a location and automatically update across the site so that it appears on the "All Events" page for all other students, leaders, and organizations to view. Organizations can keep track of their existing events on their "My Events" page.

      <div class="clear"></div>
      <p class="subtitle">Organizations can create new events, which will get assigned a location on campus and show up on the "All Events" page for others to view.</p>

      <h5>Students</h5>
      <p>Students can view view their saved events on their "My Events" page, and add view and add more events to their schedule. The events detail the start time, which organization is hosting it, and a short description of the activity. The precise location of the event can be found on the map by looking for its drop pin.</p>

      <div class="clear"></div>
      <p class="subtitle">A student user's "My Events" page and "All Events" page.</p>

      <div class="story-photo"><img src="assets/images/student-map.png"></div>
      <div class="clear"></div>
      <p class="subtitle">The map detailing the locations of the events. *UPDATE: As of recent, the map is no longer showing on the webpage--this bug has yet to be resolved.</p>

      <p>Although this web application still has a couple of unimplemented pieces, it draws a general outline of the purpose the Scheduler hopes to achieve. With the Cal Day Scheduler, both organizations and visitors will be able to come to a single place to easily navigate one of the largest annual events on campus.</p>
