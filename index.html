            My name is Emily Tsai. I am currently an undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science.
          <div>
          <div class="text">
            With my degree in computer science, I hope to bridge technology with community work, and use coding to promote welfare in underserved/under-resourced communities. As an ex-biology major and current CS tutor, I have a particularly strong interest in working in the health and education fields.

          <div class="text">
            Outside of my interests in the world of bits and algorithms, I also enjoy leading multiple lives (reading), training my body to endure hours of pain (running half-marathons), and learning/sharing highly interesting--but often irrelvant--coffee table facts. (For example, did you know that humans carry more bacteria cells inside our bodies than we have of our own human cells? You are more not-you, than you are you!)
